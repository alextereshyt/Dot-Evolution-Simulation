# DotEvolutionSim
A game that describes the simplest model of evolution.

Every living organism is a cell, and the color of this cell shows the species. During life, mutations randomly appear in organisms Mutations can be both positive and negative.
Over time, species with negative mutations die due to natural selection. 
 
# First Mode
The cell appears at the top left and grows. Cells have no limitations, so they quickly take over the entire territory and evolve.
During positive and negative mutations, a force parameter is added or subtracted to the cell type. Thus the cell in which this parameter dominates the most

# Second Mode 
In the second mode, a wall is built in the middle of the field, which is initially open and then closed after a while. Thus evolution will take place in different halves in different ways.
This proves the importance of isolation during evolution.

# Third Mode 
The third mode is the most difficult and interesting. Initially, random conditions are generated for the cells. If the cell strength parameter is approximately equal to the condition parameter, the cell can capture this area. In this way, even the weakest cells will be able to survive and be distributed in areas that cannot capture stronger cells.
