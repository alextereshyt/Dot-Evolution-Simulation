# DotEvolutionSim
A game that describes the simplest model of evolution.

Every living organism is a cell, and the color of this cell shows the species. During life, mutations randomly appear in organisms
. Mutations can be both positive and negative. Over time, species with negative mutations die due to natural selection.
